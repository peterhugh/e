Case number one is D.K. Basu vs. the State of West Bengal in the year
1997, case number two is Lalita Kumari vs. State of Uttar Pradesh and
case number three is Hardeep Singh vs. State of Punjab in 2013 and 2014
respectively.  The landmark or milestone case is D.K. Basu vs. State of
West Bengal.  When there is attack on fundamental rights through arrest,
individual may approach the court.  Facts of the D.N. Basu case are as
follows.  The Supreme Court received letter from D.K. Basu in 1986 and
A.K. Johri 1997.  D.K. Basu provided as evidence the newspaper
clippings as also A.K. Johri in respective letters.  The demand of the
petitioners was to prevent custodial deaths and frame guidelines.  On
the basis of observation the Supreme Court said that it is not good for
a civilised society as India.  It is attack on fundamental rights and
rule of law.  The first direction from the Supreme Court stated that
the officer and police at the time of arrest shall communicate their
name and their designation clearly.  The police officer at the time of
arrest shall prepare and communicate a memorandum or chargesheet to
the family member or relative of the person being arrested, the second
direction.  Third direction describes that police shall also inform
the arrested person and family member or relative of the name and
place or location where the arrested person will be camped during
arrest.  Fourth direction explains that police shall communicate the
rights of the arrested individual.  It also instructs the authority to
make arrangements for providing legal advise through an advocate,
lawyer.

Lalita Kumari case also brought in directions from the Supreme Court.
The first direction states that if an offence is cognizable then the
preliminary examination shall be carried out, an F.I.R. registered and
section 154 is applied.  Otherwise, the offence is mentioned in the
diary.  When an offence is not clear, then a preliminary examination or
investigation must be performed.  Uncognizable offence can be a
matrimonial dispute, business or corruption.  Third direction is that
the investigation shall be time-bound without delay.  As Justice
Jagdish said justice delayed is justice denied.
